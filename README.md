› The statistical summary of our linear regression model shows that the r-squared value is 0.71, which means that roughly 71% of the variablilty of our dependent variable (miles per gallon) is explained by this linear model. 

› The p-value is 5.35e-11, which is much smaller than the assumed significance level of 0.05%. Therefore, we can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero.
