› According to our results, vehicle length and ground clearance (as well as intercept) are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model. Thus,the vehicle length and ground clearance have a significant impact on miles per gallon.

› The p-value is 5.35e-11, which is much smaller than the assumed significance level of 0.05%. Therefore, we can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero.

› The statistical summary of our linear regression model shows that the r-squared value is 0.71, which means that roughly 71% of the variablilty of our dependent variable (miles per gallon) is explained by this linear model. Thus, this linear model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.
